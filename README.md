## Rapid Problem Statements
### PL1 - Azulejos
Two Portuguese ceramists team up to open an azulejos shop. They have a small shop window where they want to display some of their work in the most attractive and fair way possible: **each will display the same number of azulejos**. To make the most of the space available, they want to display **two rows of tiles**, one for each of the two artists, ensuring that all are clearly visible, including those in the back row. **Each azulejo in the back row must be higher than the one in front of it**. Another important point is **to arrange the order of price**: a customer attracted by one work will be able to admire others that they can also afford, only to give in to temptation and push open the shop door.
